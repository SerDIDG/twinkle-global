# TwinkleGlobal

TwinkleGlobal is a JavaScript application that gives Wikipedians a quick way of performing common maintenance tasks, such as nominating pages for deletion and cleaning up vandalism.

See [User:Xiplus/TwinkleGlobal][] on the Meta-Wiki for more information.

[AzaToth][] is the original author and maintainer of the tool, as well as the `morebits.js` library gadget, which forms the basis for many Wikipedia scripts and editing tools in addition to Twinkle.
